You may noticed that I didn't include any instructions on how to run this project in the README file. However, I want to clarify that this was an intentional decision on my part.

I have been working on this project with the intention of selling it for commercial purposes. Therefore, I have chosen not to include detailed instructions in the README file in order to protect the value and exclusivity of the project for potential buyers.

If you are interested in purchasing this project for commercial use, I would be happy to discuss the terms and provide you with the necessary information. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with the discussion.

Thank you for your understanding.
